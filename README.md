A 3D art gallery quickly fashioned with p5.js (a JavaScript graphics library) and all the art I finished over the summer.

## Description

The artworks themselves are a mix of creative coding, traditional art, and digital art. They are manually arranged on an interactive 3D cube situated in a black void of stars, some of which orbit around the cube. The artworks subtlety and slowly move in and out, while the bottom face of the cube contains a title with an animated background.
